<h1>JOSE GONZALEZ</h1>
<p>I’m Jose and i’m a Graphic Design junior here at SJSU. I’ve been interested in Graphic Design, not only because it’s something i’ve grown up with and consciously observed for years now, but because it is a great creative outlet that allows me to create graphical solutions for whatever I end up doing or wherever I end up in the future. Being born and raised in San Diego, and pretty much living there my whole life really set me up to be in a very comfortable position where I worked a steady job and was close to friends and family on both sides of the border. Transfering to SJSU and moving to San Jose really took me away from that comfort zone and forced me to push myself in taking on new challenges in life. Working around different places and different faces has me excited and anxious for what comes next. Being back in school gives me different perspectives of work I haven’t seen before and is exciting to think of all the different kinds of graphical solutions I'll be able to develop here.</p>
